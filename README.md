# Machine Learning Specialization - Coursera

This 3-course Specialization is an updated version of Andrewâ€™s pioneering Machine Learning course, rated 4.9 out of 5 and taken by over 4.8 million learners since it launched in 2012. 

It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)

## C01 - Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, we see how to:

	- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
	- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.
	
## C02 - Advanced Learning ALgorithms 

In the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, we see how to:

	- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
	- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.
	- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.
	
## C03 - Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

In the third course of the Machine Learning Specialization, we see how to:

	- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
	- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
	- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
